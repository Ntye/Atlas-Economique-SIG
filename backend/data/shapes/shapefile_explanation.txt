# Explanation of Shapefile Components

The files you have (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`) are components of an ESRI Shapefile, a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information systems (GIS). A shapefile spatially describes geometric features such like points, lines, and polygons. It stores non-topological geometry and attribute information for the spatial features.

For a shapefile to be complete and usable, at least three files with the same prefix (e.g., `gadm41_CMR_0`) and different extensions (`.shp`, `.shx`, and `.dbf`) must be present in the same directory.

Here's a breakdown of each file type:

1.  **`.shp` (Shape Format):**
    *   **Content:** This is the main file that stores the feature geometry itself. It contains the geographic coordinates that define the shapes (e.g., the boundaries of administrative regions, points of interest, or paths of roads).
    *   **Use:** It is the core spatial data component, providing the visual representation on a map.

2.  **`.shx` (Shape Index Format):**
    *   **Content:** This file stores a positional index of the feature geometry. It links the `.shp` file to the `.dbf` file and allows GIS software to quickly seek backward and forward through the `.shp` file.
    *   **Use:** Improves performance when accessing specific spatial features, as it avoids reading the entire `.shp` file to find a particular shape.

3.  **`.dbf` (Attribute Format):**
    *   **Content:** This file stores the attribute information (non-spatial data) for each geometric feature in a dBase IV format. For example, if the `.shp` file defines country borders, the `.dbf` file might contain attributes like country name, population, area, etc., for each country. Each row in the `.dbf` corresponds to a feature in the `.shp` file.
    *   **Use:** Provides descriptive information about each geographic feature, enabling spatial analysis and thematic mapping.

## How they are stored in the project:

These files **must always be stored together in the same directory** for the shapefile to be valid and readable by GIS software. They are intrinsically linked, and separating them will render the shapefile unusable.

**Recommendation:**
It is best practice to keep all the related files for a single shapefile (e.g., `gadm41_CMR_0.shp`, `gadm41_CMR_0.shx`, `gadm41_CMR_0.dbf`, and any other auxiliary files like `.prj`, `.cpg` if they exist) within the same dedicated subfolder or alongside each other in a specific GIS data directory within your project structure. This ensures data integrity and ease of management.

For your specific project, it appears you have multiple shapefiles (`gadm41_CMR_0` through `gadm41_CMR_3`), likely representing different administrative levels or types of geographic features. Each set of `.shp`, `.shx`, and `.dbf` (and any other associated files) for a given `_X` should be treated as a single, indivisible unit. The current structure, where all these files reside in the `shapes` directory, is appropriate as long as the full set for each `gadm41_CMR_X` is kept together.
